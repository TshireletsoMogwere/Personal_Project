# Queue number system:

**Objective** :  To improve service and staff efficiency and help decrease patient wait and service times.

**Inspiration** : I always see in such areas, people would come early yet stay until evening without getting any help yet people who arrive during the day are able to get help fast. This may be caused due to the company being disorganised and staff being unable to manage queues on their own so a system will avoid so many complications like patients not knowing where to queue correctly, who was first and which rooms they should be referd to.
